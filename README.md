# Cookie Clicker Autoclicker

1) Run
2) Open [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) on a browser tab, preferably on fullscreen
3) Place mouse over cookie, it will click 1000 times per second
4) Come back later


Should probably make it work for any window size 
and any window position but I built this tool just
so I would not spend any more time on this friggin thing.
Time to waste my time on something else I guess
